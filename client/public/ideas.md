  **Design Movement**: **Neo-Brutalism / Digital Maximalism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw & Unapologetic**: Embrace bold contrasts, thick outlines, and a "digital-native" feel that speaks to modern creative industries.
  2. **Grid-Breaking Layouts**: Move away from standard containers; use overlapping elements, marquee text, and asymmetrical positioning.
  3. **High-Energy Interaction**: The site should feel alive with constant, subtle motion (scrolling marquees, hover distortions).
  4. **Content as Visual**: Treat text (especially headlines) as graphic elements, using size and weight to create impact.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Deep Charcoal (#121212) - Provides a grounding canvas.
  - **Accent**: Acid Green (#CCFF00) - High-visibility, energetic, digital-first.
  - **Secondary**: Electric Purple (#9D00FF) - Adds depth and a creative edge.
  - **Intent**: To signal "cutting-edge" and "bold thinker." It's not just a portfolio; it's a statement.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular/Bento Box**: Content is organized in distinct, bold-bordered blocks that stack and rearrange.
  - **Sticky Elements**: Navigation and key CTAs stick in unexpected places (e.g., bottom corners or side rails).

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Marquee Scrollers**: Infinite scrolling text for skills or testimonials.
  - **Brutalist Buttons**: Sharp corners, heavy borders, solid hover fills.
  - **Glitch Effects**: Subtle chromatic aberration on hover for project cards.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons should feel "heavy" and responsive.
  - **Cursor Effects**: A custom cursor that reacts to different content types (e.g., "View" expands on project cards).

  **Animation**:
  - **Snappy & Linear**: Transitions should be quick and decisive, not soft or eased.
  - **Reveal on Scroll**: Elements slide up or reveal from behind masks with a hard cut.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Space Grotesk** or **Syne** (Bold/Extra Bold) - Characterful, slightly quirky sans-serifs.
  - **Body**: **DM Sans** or **JetBrains Mono** - Clean, legible, with a tech/code nod.

  **Design Movement**: **Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (Modernized)**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Objective Clarity**: Content is king. The design serves to present the work with absolute precision and minimal distraction.
  2. **Mathematical Grids**: A visible or highly structured grid system that organizes content logically.
  3. **Asymmetry**: Use whitespace and asymmetrical layouts to create dynamic tension and interest.
  4. **Typography as Image**: Large, scaling typography is the primary visual element.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Off-White / Light Gray (#F5F5F5) or Deep Navy (#0A192F) - Clean, neutral backdrops.
  - **Accent**: International Orange (#FF4500) or Neon Cyan (#00FFFF) - Used sparingly for focus points.
  - **Intent**: To convey "strategic," "organized," and "professional." It reflects the "Business" side of "Creative Business."

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Split Screen**: Vertical division between navigation/context and scrolling content.
  - **Whitespace Dominance**: Large margins and padding to let the work breathe.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Huge Typography**: Section headers that span the full width or height of the screen.
  - **Fine Lines**: Thin, precise dividers (1px) separating content sections.
  - **Numbered Lists**: Emphasizing process and structure (01, 02, 03).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth & Fluid**: Interactions should feel effortless and frictionless.
  - **Parallax**: Subtle parallax effects on images vs. text to create depth.

  **Animation**:
  - **Eased & Elegant**: Slow, smooth eases (cubic-bezier) for all transitions.
  - **Staggered Reveals**: Text lines revealing one by one.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Helvetica Now** or **Neue Haas Grotesk** - The gold standard of neutrality and clarity.
  - **Body**: **Inter** or **Roboto** - Highly readable, functional.

  **Design Movement**: **Dark Mode Futurism / Cyber-Minimalism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Immersive Depth**: Use dark backgrounds with glowing elements to create a sense of depth and atmosphere.
  2. **Glassmorphism**: Translucent layers and blurs to create hierarchy and modern texture.
  3. **Focus on Light**: Light is used to guide the user's eye (glows, gradients, spotlights).
  4. **Clean & Sleek**: Minimal clutter, high contrast, premium feel.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Void Black (#050505) - Infinite depth.
  - **Accent**: Neon Green (#00FF88) - The "matrix" or "code" aesthetic, modernized.
  - **Secondary**: Holographic Gradients (Subtle touches of purple/blue).
  - **Intent**: To signal "digital-native," "tech-savvy," and "future-ready." Perfectly aligns with Digital Marketing and UX.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Centralized Focus**: Key content is centered and highlighted, with peripheral elements fading back.
  - **Floating Cards**: Content exists on floating layers with soft glows/shadows.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Glowing Gradients**: Subtle background orbs that shift slowly.
  - **Glass Cards**: Frosted glass effects for navigation and overlays.
  - **Tech Details**: Small UI elements like crosshairs, coordinates, or data points as decoration.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover Glows**: Elements light up or glow when interacted with.
  - **Magnetic Buttons**: Buttons that slightly pull towards the cursor.

  **Animation**:
  - **Cinematic**: Slow fades, zooms, and blurs.
  - **Atmospheric**: Background elements moving independently of scroll.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Outfit** or **Manrope** - Modern, geometric sans-serifs.
  - **Body**: **Satoshi** or **Plus Jakarta Sans** - Clean, approachable, modern.
